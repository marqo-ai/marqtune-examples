# Marqtune Examples

This repository contains examples for using [Marqtune](https://cloud.marqo.ai/marqtune/), the embedding model training platform, created by [Marqo](https://marqo.ai/).

## Set Up
To use Marqtune you will need:

- Python (3.11+)
- A [Marqo API key](https://cloud.marqo.ai/settings/api-keys/) with access to Marqtune. To obtain this, sign up to [Marqo Cloud](https://cloud.marqo.ai/authentication/register/) and navigate to the [API keys](https://cloud.marqo.ai/settings/api-keys/) section and create your own. For more information, see this [article](https://marqo.ai/blog/finding-my-marqo-api-key).
- The Marqtune Python client. You can install this using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install marqtune
    ```

Now you're ready to start fine-tuning your own embedding models! 

## Marqtune Walkthrough
We have an [article](https://marqo.ai/blog/getting-started-with-marqtune) that walks you through getting set up in Marqtune. The code in this article can be found in the `simple-walkthrough` directory. We encourage you to read this article before executing the code so you understand the steps involved in setting up Marqtune. All you have to do is run `marqtune-walkthrough.py` locally or visit our Google Colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/132QX_LM1db0huNpN41Vg62otSfcNuJu6?usp=sharing).
